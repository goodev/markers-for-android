  * **Why is my drawing all black when I save it to Gallery?** — The drawing is actually on a transparent background, so you're seeing Gallery's black background through it. When you load it back into Markers or send it to another app, you'll see that the drawing is intact. If you'd prefer an opaque background, longpress on a color in the palette to set the paper color.

  * **What's up with the pressure sensitivity on my device?** — See DeviceSupport.
