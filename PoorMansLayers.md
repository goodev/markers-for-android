# Introduction #

Markers is a very simple painting program, inspired by classics like MacPaint: there is one fullscreen canvas into which pixels may be drawn, and that’s it.

Because the Markers canvas starts out transparent, however, you can achieve a kind of layering effect by saving each layer independently to the Gallery and then loading those layers on top of one another to composite them.

## Example ##

The following illustrations are intermediate stages of the [Markers app icon](https://picasaweb.google.com/114592751246503219483/TheMarkersIconStepByStep):

<table>

<tr><td width='300px'><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw line art, black-on-transparent. Save to Gallery.</td><td> <img src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_GZ5WjtgLY4/T-aUgo2l6mI/AAAAAAAAUZM/ywFf61UCs_s/s288/1336441632190.png' /> </td></tr>

<tr><td> <strong>Step 2:</strong>  Color sloppily over the lines; this paint layer will go behind the line art. </td><td> <img src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dsoYjK3G5_U/T-aUg7-Q6JI/AAAAAAAAUZI/_nXNQNRItg4/s288/1336441745035.png' /> </td></tr>

<tr><td> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the overflow menu to load the line art from Gallery (careful, it’s going to be hard to see, as it’s black-on-transparent in a black window) back on top of the color. </td><td> <img src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Y0J15PN4EpM/T-aUhYq-UxI/AAAAAAAAUZs/68H1QYDkPeU/s288/1336441849694.png' /> </td></tr>
